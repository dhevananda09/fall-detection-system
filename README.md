# Fall Detection System for Senior Citizens

A smart wearable-based fall detection system designed to detect fall incidents in real-time and alert caregivers.

## Objective
- Reliable real-time fall detection using sensors and AI techniques
- Reduce false alerts and improve safety of elderly people

## Sensors & Tools Used
- Arduino UNO
- ADXL345 Accelerometer
- Libraries: Wire.h, Adafruit_Sensor.h, Adafruit_ADXL345_U.h

## Features
- Detects sudden motion changes using acceleration magnitude
- Confirms fall using angle change analysis
- Designed for low-cost implementation

## Sample Output
The system prints motion values (AM) and confirms fall detection through Serial Monitor.

## Status
✅ Completed Mini Project (Report Uploaded)
